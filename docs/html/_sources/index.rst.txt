Welcome to Mayawaves's documentation!
=====================================

`Mayawaves` is a python library for the analysis of numerical relativity simulations of binary black holes performed
with the Einstein Toolkit (https://einsteintoolkit.org) or provided through the MAYA public waveform catalog
(https://cgp.ph.utexas.edu/waveform).

Numerical relativity simulations produce large amounts of data and are generally performed over the course of many days.
The data generated by such simulations is typically broken into multiple output directories, the data within which must
be stitched together to process the whole simulation. This library is designed to streamline the processing and
analsis of these simulations.

`Mayawaves` stitches together raw numerical relativity simulations and stores them in h5 files, a format that handles
numerical data more efficiently than ascii. This reduces the disc space taken by the simulation while still retaining
the precision of the raw data.

Some of the key functionalities of this library are as follows:

* read and stitch raw numerical relativity data
* store numerical relativity data in a more efficient format
* track properties of the black holes (trajectories, spins, masses, horizon information, etc.)
* compute information about the binary orbit (eccentricity, separation, orbital frequency, kick, etc.)
* compute quantities pertaining to the gravitational radiation (:math:`\Psi_4`, strain, extrapolated strain, energy radiated, etc.)
* export numerical relativity data to the format required for LIGO analyses
* analyze the MAYA waveform catalog

Follow the tutorials to learn how to use this library to analyze both your own simulations and the simulations in the
MAYA Catalog
(https://cgp.ph.utexas.edu/waveform).
